            <h1>WELCOME TO OUR DISTRICT</h1>
            <h1>WEST CHAMPARAN</h1>
            <p>West Champaran District was carved out of the old Champaran District in the year 1972 as a result of
                re-organization of the District in the state. It was formerly a subdivision of Saran District and then
                Champaran District with its Head quarters as Bettiah. It is said that Bettiah got its name from Baint
                (Cane) plants commonly found in this district. The name Champaran is a degenerate form of Champaka
                aranya, a name which dates back to the time when the district was a tract of the forest of Champa
                (Magnolia) trees & was the abode of solitary asectics.

                As per District Gazetteer, it seems probable that Champaran was occupied at an early period by races of
                Aryan descent and formed part of the country in which the Videha empire ruled. After the fall of Videhan
                empire the district formed part of the Vrijjain oligarchical republic with its capital at Vaishali of
                which Lichhavis were the most powerful and prominent. Ajatshatru the emperor of Magadh, by tact and
                force annexed Lichhavis and occupied its capital, Vaishali. He extended his sovereignty over Paschim
                Champaran which continued under the Mauryan rule for the next hundred years. After the Mauryas, the
                Sungas and Kanvas ruled over the Magadh territories. The district thereafter formed part of the Kushan
                empire and then came under Gupta empire. Along with Tirhut, Champaran was possibly annexed by Harsha
                during whose reign Huen- Tsang, the famous Chinese pilgrim, visited India. During 750 to 1155 AD , the
                Palas of Bengal were in the possession of Eastern India and Champaran formed the part of their
                territory. Towards the close of the 10th century Gangaya Deva of the Kalacheeri dynasty conquered
                Champaran .He was succeeded by Vikramaditya of the Chalukya dynasty.

                During 1213 and 1227,the first Muslim influence was experienced when Ghyasuddin Iwaz the Muslim governor
                of Bengal extended his influence over Tribhukti or Tirhut .It was however, not a complete conquest and
                he was only able to have Tirhut from Narsinghdeva, a Simraon king.In about 1320, Ghyasuddin Tughlaq
                annexed Tirhut to the Tughlaq Empire and placed it under Kameshwar Thakur, who established Sugaon or
                Thakur dynasty. This dynasty continued to rule the area till Nasrat Shah, son of Allauddin Shah attacked
                Tirhut in 1530, annexed the territory,and killed the Raja and thus put an end to the Thakur dynasty.
                Nasrat Shah appointed his son-in-law as viceroy of Tirhut and thence forward the country continued to be
                ruled by the Muslim rulers. After the fall of Mughal Empire the British rulers came to power in India.
