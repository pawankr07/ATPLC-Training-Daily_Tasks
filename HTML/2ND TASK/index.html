        The topography of Motihari has been described as scenic, with the "stunning beauty" (in classical terms) of Moti
        Jheel Lake dividing the town in two halves.[7]

        In Gangan Lit-Mag (Gangway Literary Magazine), Austria, wrote Anant Kumar: "The playgrounds of my childhood were
        the streets of Motihari. Back then that little East Indian town was not overpopulated, and the dry, clean
        streets of every part of town were ideal for our games: marbles, tops, badminton. And back then Motihari was a
        wide distance away from the big world. There were very many mango and lichee trees, fragrant lemon bushes,
        broad, large fieldsâ€¦and very few people. There were scattered decrepit hawelis and bungalows, in which
        frightening bhuts, geniis and juraels dwelled.
