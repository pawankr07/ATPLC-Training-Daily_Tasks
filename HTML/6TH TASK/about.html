    <p align="center" style="font-weight: bold;">First Creation of Champarn District : 1866 On 2nd November 1972
        Champaran district was split up Into two
        districts, viz. Purbi Champaran and Paschim Champaran. East Champaran is a part of Tirhut Division. The
        headquarter of Purbi Champaran district is at Motihari .Presently Purbi Champaran consists of Six Subdivisions
        and Twenty Seven Blocks. Nepal makes its northern boundary, Sitamadhi and Sheohar eastern while Muzaffarpur
        South and with part of Gopalganj bounds it in western side. The name Champaran owes its origin to Champa-aranya
        or Champkatanys. Champa or Champaka means Magnolia and aranya mess forest. Hence, Champaranya means Forest of
        Magnolia (CHAMPA) trees. It is popularly believed that the nomenclature here was made while the vest forest part
        was inhabited by solitary ascetics. It is needless to say that has Purbi means Eastern Side.</p>
