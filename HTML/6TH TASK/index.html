        The topography of Motihari has been described as scenic, with the "stunning beauty" (in classical terms) of Moti
        Jheel Lake dividing the town in two halves.[7]

        In Gangan Lit-Mag (Gangway Literary Magazine), Austria, wrote Anant Kumar: "The playgrounds of my childhood were
        the streets of Motihari. Back then that little East Indian town was not overpopulated, and the dry, clean
        streets of every part of town were ideal for our games: marbles, tops, badminton. And back then Motihari was a
        wide distance away from the big world. There were very many mango and lichee trees, fragrant lemon bushes,
        broad, large fields…and very few people. There were scattered decrepit hawelis and bungalows, in which
        frightening bhuts, geniis and juraels dwelled.

    <P>First Creation of Champarn District : 1866 On 2nd November 1972 Champaran district was split up Into two
        districts, viz. Purbi Champaran and Paschim Champaran. East Champaran is a part of Tirhut Division. The
        headquarter of Purbi Champaran district is at Motihari .Presently Purbi Champaran consists of Six Subdivisions
        and Twenty Seven Blocks. Nepal makes its northern boundary, Sitamadhi and Sheohar eastern while Muzaffarpur
        South and with part of Gopalganj bounds it in western side. The name Champaran owes its origin to Champa-aranya
        or Champkatanys. Champa or Champaka means Magnolia and aranya mess forest. Hence, Champaranya means Forest of
        Magnolia (CHAMPA) trees. It is popularly believed that the nomenclature here was made while the vest forest part
        was inhabited by solitary ascetics. It is needless to say that has Purbi means Eastern Side.</P>

    </h1>

    <p>It was Champaran that acquainted me with India, Mahatma Gandhi wrote in one of his letters. BAPU Father of our
        nation while his visit to Champaran on request of Raj kumar Shukla (A farmer belonging to land of East
        Champaran), got impetus to start a movement against the dictatorship of British government. Those days the
        farmers of East Champaran were coerced to sow AFEEM (opium) and NEEL (indigo)on certain portion of their farms
        so that British government can make money out of it.

        Mahatama Gandhi arrived at Motihari, with Rajkumar Shukla on April 15, 1917. Gandhi Ji was welcomed by congress
        workers and local farmers at Motihari railway station and taken to the home of lawyer Gorakh Prasad at
        Dharmsamaj street area of Motihari at that point started his correspondence with local farmers.

        Gandhi was communicated about the barbarities on indigo farmers in Champaran at the 31st meeting of the Indian
        National Congress in Lucknow. In a composed explanation, Shukla expressed that the East India Company had begun
        indigo farming in India, including Champaran.

        These crops make the agricultural land infertile. Also British government was not paying enough money to the
        farmers and so the plight of farmers became worse with time. Fed up with this system , one of the farmer named
        Raj Kumar shukla invited Bapu to have a visit to their place and help them in extirpating this law to make their
        life better.

        To ameliorate the condition of these indenture farmers of Chamapran, BAPU visited Motihari on 10th April 1917.
        If we go by the report of AICC (All India congress committee) a huge mass has greeted him in his mission to get
        INDIPENDENCE and make INDIA free of BRITISH rules. The plight of these farmers made BAPU to start a historic
        movement named CHAMPARAN SATYAGRAH.

        In spite of getting threatening messages from British government BAPU kept this movement alive and accepted the
        imprisonment. Respecting the summon , he appeared in court of Sub divisional magistrate of Motihari on 8th April
        1917. There he avowed not to obey the Rules imposed by BRITISH govt.

        He also visited West champaran (Bettiah) on 22nd April 1917. It was the people of whole Champaran who
        participated in this movement to make it successful and that’s how this place got registered in the pages of
        Indian National movement. Besides non co-operation movement, demonstration against SIMON commission in year
        1929, gathering in Motihari against the failure of Round table conference to pledge for Indian Independence are
        some more historic events related to this place.</p>

    <p>Satyagraha movement was started by
        Mahatma Gandhi from the land of Champaran in Bihar. In April 1917, on the
        request of Rajkumar Shukla, Mahatma Gandhi went to Champaran and started the Satyagraha movement against the
        cultivation of neel. Satyagraha movement was the first mass movement done by Mahatma Gandhi in India.

        Satyagraha movement proved to be milestone in the history of India’s freedom. Prior to the Satyagraha movement,
        Mahatma Gandhi used to be a prominent lawyer in South Africa. It is said that since the Satyagraha movement,
        people started to know Mohan Das Karam Chand Gandhi by the name of ‘Mahatma’.

        Rajkumar Shukla calls from Mahatma Gandhi to see the plight of Neel farmers. Seeing the plight of the farmers,
        Gandhiji decided to oppose it, which gradually turned into a big movement. In this movement, the well-known
        faces of Bihar were associated with Gandhiji, among them Rajendra Prasad, Ramnavami Prasad, Babu Brijkishore
        were the chiefs.

        On 15th April Gandhiji reached Motihari, Motihari, which is today also the headquarters of East Champaran
        district. After reaching Motihari, Gandhiji sent messages from the other corner of the country to his known
        people.

        Gandhiji started the movement with a village of Motihari in Jasalpatti, because a recent incident occurred in
        Jasalpatti. In the camp of the British, there was a different rift due to this movement. Gandhiji had understood
        the oppressive policies of the British behind the cultivation of Neel. Neel’s cultivation is farmed against
        nature, due to which there is a huge loss to farmer’s farm.

        The Satyagraha movement, run by Mahatma Gandhi, gained not only the fame of the whole world, but this movement
        shook the British empire. When Gandhiji reached Motihari in 1917, he reviewed about 2900 villages
